Once upon a time there was an old woman who loved baking gingerbread. She would bake gingerbread cookies, cakes,
houses and gingerbread people, all decorated with chocolate and peppermint, caramel candies and colored frosting.

She lived with her husband on a farm at the edge of town. The sweet spicy smell of gingerbread brought children
skipping and running to see what would be offered that day.
